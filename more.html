        <h4>Experiences at Camp</h4>
        <p>For about two years I assisted Camp Tawingo as a camper. There, you can apply to be back as a counsellor, and depending on your skills you may or may not be called back. Fortunately, they really liked my people skills among other abilities. I was very helpful when teaching campcraft skills or canoeing. For this reason, I was a counsellor there for 2 years in a row. I had to stop because the third season of camp was on the month of august, which was unfortunate because classes at university started. It was much harder to skip those classes that the ones at school, so I had to decide to not go back to camp. </p>

      <h4>Experiences at motorcycle riding</h4>
      <div class="parrafo">
        <p>Since I was very small (about 3 years old), I always asked my parents if I could get a motorcycle. I was practically in love with them since both my oldest brothers had at least one. When I was 5 years old, Santa brought me my first motorcycle. It was a small 50cc semi-automatic motorcycle. Up to this day, this one is my favorite by far since it is the least dangerous and the easiest one to use. Here I have taught my small nephew in this motorcycle and now I ride along him like my brother did with me 17 years ago. I think this sport is one of the most relaxing to do when you just ride along with friends.</p>
